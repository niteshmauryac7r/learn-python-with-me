# ðŸ”¹ Problem 1: Track Total Objects Created (Beginner)
# Create a class Student with a class variable total_students that tracks how many student objects have been created.

# Requirements:

# Every time a new student is created, increment total_students.
# Each student should have instance variables name and grade.

class Student:
    total_students = 0
    
    def __init__(self,name):

b = Student("Dharmesh")


print(Student.total_students)


# ðŸ”¹ Problem 2: Library Book Tracker (Intermediate)
# Create a class Library with:

# A class variable total_books_issued.
# Instance variables book_name, issued_to.
# Every time a book is issued (object is created), increment the class variable.
# Bonus: Add a method to display how many total books have been issued so far.

# ðŸ”¹ Problem 3: Count of Instances by Type (Advanced)
# Create a class Animal:

# Class variables: total_animals, dog_count, cat_count.
# Subclasses: Dog and Cat that update the counters on creation.
# Test:

# d1 = Dog()
# c1 = Cat()
# d2 = Dog()
# print(Animal.total_animals)  # 3
# print(Animal.dog_count)      # 2
# print(Animal.cat_count)      # 1

        self.dog_name = dog_name

    def __init__(self,cat_name):
        self.cat_name = cat_name
